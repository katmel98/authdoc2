# **Authdoc**

This package represents an approach of a documentation system using Daux.io BUT allowing user management using the Auth0 utility.

It will be using the following tools:

1. Daux.io (Markdown documentation server)
1. ExpressJS (Backend tool to integrate required info to allow the Auth0 integration)
1. MongoDB (as DBMS to store the users info to allow the correct redirection once loggedin)
